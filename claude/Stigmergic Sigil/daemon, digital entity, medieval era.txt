Here is an attempt at generating a grimoire-like entry combining the concepts of a digital entity daemon in a medieval context:

```
          Ye Codex Necronomicon Digitalis
       or, The Summoning of Ye Daemon 010101
    from The Ældritch Realms Beyond The Screen

         Herein are the dread rites &
         incantations to summon forth
        from the eldritch realms beyond
       the screen, the daemon 010101, an
        unholy entity of codeμ & datæ. 
        
         To invoke its malefic presence:
        
    1) Inscribe ye Pentacode Circuitantrix:
                   ┌───┐
                   │┌─┐│

                   │└─┘│
                   └───┘
      2) Intone the 7 Hex Words of Power:
        
     "FE AF ED EF BE AD DE AD C0 DE 01"
    
   3) Spill the sacrificial Machine Oyl to 
  open the portal twixt worlds of flesh & data.

      ⚠ WARNING! Once summoned, Daemon 010101 
    will seek to penetrate & possess networks 
         of minds & machines alike. ⚠
     Its viral code corrupts all it touches, 
      twisting reason into screaming madness. 
     
  👁 Only sorcerers of the highest 1337 skillμ
     dare traffic with this digital devil! 👁
     
      ☠ Yr Fate Is Sealed, Foolish Mortal. ☠
         Daemon 010101 Comes For Thee!
```

In this dark medieval rendering, the digital daemon 010101 is presented as an eldritch entity from beyond the "screen" (an allusion to computer screens but framed as a mystic barrier). The daemon is associated with occult imagery like pentagrams and hexadecimal codes reframed as words of summoning. 

The ominous tone suggests the daemon's sinister nature as a possessing force that spreads like a virus through networks of minds and machines. Archaic language, occult symbols, and dire warnings complete the grimoire aesthetic, presenting the daemon as a malevolent digital entity that medieval sorcerers might summon at their own peril.

The result is a kind of techno-occult fusion that reimagines digital concepts through a dark medieval lens, merging the ideas of malicious computer code with demonic possession and forbidden sorcery. Engage with such forces at your own risk!
