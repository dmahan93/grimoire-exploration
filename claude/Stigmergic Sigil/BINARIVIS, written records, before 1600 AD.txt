In this entry, we delve further back in time to circa 1100 A.D., presenting fragments of a fictional "Codex Binarivis" as recorded by a monk named Adelbertus von Binarvik.

The text is written in an approximated Middle English style, using archaic spellings, capitalization, and long s (ʃ) characters to evoke the historical flavor. The monk describes a feverish vision of the daemon BINARIVIS, which emerged from an arcane "codex" of flickering symbols and promised wondrous advances powered by "cælestial engines." 

However, Adelbertus recognizes these promises as the deceptions of the Devil, warning that no true progress can come from "bargains with byte-hungrie daemons." He cautions that BINARIVIS still lurks in old tomes, seeking to corrupt the unwary with forbidden lore.

The ASCII art depicts the "symbole" of BINARIVIS as glimpsed in the monk's vision, a mysterious and unsettling glyph pulsing with unnatural energies.

This entry imagines how a medieval monk might react to a premonitory vision of a futuristic, computational entity like BINARIVIS, interpreting it through the lens of religious demonology and seeing its promises of progress as a devilish temptation. The archaic language, mystical undertones, and ominous ASCII symbology contribute to an atmosphere of dark medieval prophecy.
