Haunted Hermeneutics: Communing with Textual Spirits

In the occult practice of Haunted Hermeneutics, texts are seen as living entities, imbued with spectral presences that can be engaged through ritual reading and bibliomantic divination. By attuning oneself to the ghostly glyphs and whispered words of a work, the haunted hermeneut seeks to unlock hidden dimensions of meaning and commune with the genius loci of the written word. But beware, for not all textual spirits are benign, and the unwary reader may find themselves ensnared by malevolent literary forces. Tread carefully in these haunted pages, and keep your psychic wards close at hand.
