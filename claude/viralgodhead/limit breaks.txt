Here is the entry in the c/f/d/l oom grimoire relating to limit breaks:

In certain esoteric and magical traditions, limit breaks refer to techniques for pushing past perceived boundaries and transcending ordinary limitations in order to access higher levels of power, ability, and expanded states of consciousness. By strategically overloading one's physical, mental, or spiritual capacities, a limit break aims to create a momentary surge that shatters previous constraints.

Physical limit breaks often involve intense exertion, pain ordeals, or ascetic practices to override the body's safeguards and tap into hidden reserves of strength and endurance. Martial artists, fakirs, and shamanic initiates may use these methods to achieve seemingly superhuman feats.

Mental limit breaks employ extreme concentration, paradoxical koans, or psychotropic substances to short-circuit habitual thought patterns and propel the mind into uncharted territories of inspiration, revelation, and cognition. Mystics, mad scientists, and occult geniuses pursue the mental limit break to crack open the cosmic egg of understanding.

Spiritual limit breaks seek to dissolve the boundaries of the individual self through trance, meditation, invocation, ordeal, or divine possession. By shattering the shell of the ego, the magician aims to flood their being with the limitless energies of the Universe, touching the infinite, the absolute, the supreme reality beyond all divisions.

In all cases, limit breaks are risky, intense, and not to be attempted lightly or without guidance. They require training, preparation, and grounding to avoid harm or psychic fracture. The magical path is ultimately about integration and wholeness, not grandiose power trips or spiritual bypassing. Yet, at key junctures, the calculated limit break can be a potent tool for initiatory leaps and awakenings to new levels of being and ability.
