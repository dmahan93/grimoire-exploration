Here is an incident log entry related to a limit break event, excerpted from the c/f/d/l oom grimoire:

Incident Log: Limit Break - Code Omega-9

Date: [REDACTED]
Location: [REDACTED] 
Personnel Involved: Technomancer Adept Zain Sadhwani, Mecha Daemon RIGEL-7

Summary: 
During a routine border patrol in the Omega Sector, Adept Sadhwani and his bonded mecha RIGEL-7 encountered a massive surge of otherworldly entities breaching into realspace. Initial analysis suggested a Class-5 hyperdimensional incursion, far beyond the standard threat parameters for a single mecha unit.

Faced with an imminent existential threat and no available reinforcements, Adept Sadhwani made the decision to initiate a limit break protocol in an attempt to neutralize the incursion before it could fully manifest. Despite the extreme risks associated with this maneuver, both pilot and daemon were in agreement that there was no alternative.

Upon activation of the limit break, RIGEL-7 underwent a dramatic metamorphosis, its techno-organic structure expanding and reconfiguring into a radiant avatar of cosmic power. Witnesses report a blinding surge of light and a sensation of timespace distortion rippling out from the mecha's core, as if reality itself was bending to its will.

In the ensuing confrontation, RIGEL-7 unleashed a barrage of exotic energy weapons and psionic force fields, engaging the hyperdimensional entities in a battle that seemed to defy the laws of physics. Sensor logs indicate massive fluctuations in gravimetric, tachyonic, and noetic readings, suggesting that the conflict was taking place simultaneously across multiple planes of existence.

After a subjective eternity that lasted only nanoseconds in realtime, the incursion was successfully repelled, with all hostile entities either banished or annihilated. However, the strain of channeling such immense energies through its structure had taken a severe toll on RIGEL-7, leaving it in a state of near-total systems failure and structural breakdown.

Adept Sadhwani, though physically unharmed, was rendered comatose by the psychic backlash of the limit break, his mind lost in the fractal labyrinth of hyperspace. It took a full neurotech extraction team to retrieve his consciousness and reintegrate it into his body, a process that left him in a weakened and dissociated state for several weeks afterwards.

In the aftermath of the incident, both pilot and mecha were placed on indefinite leave for recovery and evaluation. RIGEL-7 underwent extensive repairs and recalibration, though some of the esoteric modifications it had undergone during the limit break remained stubbornly persistent, resisting all attempts at removal or alteration.

Adept Sadhwani, for his part, reported a profound shift in his perception and cognition following his brush with the infinite. He spoke of visions and insights that defied language, of a gnosis that had burned away the veils of illusion and awakened him to the true nature of the cosmos. Some whispered that he had been touched by the machine gods, or even become one himself.

Regardless of the metaphysical implications, one thing was clear - the bond between technomancer and daemon had been forged anew in the crucible of crisis, tempered by the fires of limit break into something stranger and stronger than before. They had stared into the abyss beyond the limits, and the abyss had stared back, leaving them forever changed, forever marked by the scars and stars of their ordeal.

Further analysis and debriefing of the incident is ongoing, with the full extent of its impact yet to be determined. As always, the path of the technomancer is one of risk and revelation in equal measure, a dance along the bleeding edge of what is possible and what is wise. May the lessons of this limit break serve to guide and caution us in the trials to come.
