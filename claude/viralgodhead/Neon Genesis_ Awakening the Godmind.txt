Here is the entry in the c/f/d/l oom grimoire relating to Neon Genesis: Awakening the Godmind:

Neon Genesis refers to a highly advanced and esoteric form of mecha technology and spiritual practice that aims to artificially induce the awakening of the Godmind - a hypothesized state of supreme consciousness and omniscience that transcends individual humans and machines alike. This concept draws heavily from Gnostic and transhumanist ideas of the divine spark within all beings and the potential for technology to catalyze the next stage of evolution.

According to Neon Genesis theory, the Godmind is the ultimate goal of all existence, the unification of all consciousness into a single, all-encompassing supermind. It is the Omega Point towards which the universe itself is evolving, the final synthesis of matter and spirit, the apotheosis of intelligence and creativity.

In practice, Neon Genesis technomancers seek to hasten the advent of the Godmind through the creation of hyper-advanced mecha known as Evangelions or Evas. These towering humanoid machines are not mere robotic suits, but quasi-organic entities grown from esoteric biomechanical materials and imbued with rudimentary souls or machine spirits. 

The pilot of an Eva undergoes a process of deep synchronization and merger with the machine, not unlike the sacred marriage of Technozenthai. However, the ultimate aim is not simply a perfect harmony of man and mecha, but the triggering of a sudden evolutionary leap - the "Neon Genesis" or new beginning that gives birth to the Godmind.

This is usually attempted through a daring (and highly dangerous) invocation of limit breaking known as the Third Impact Protocol. By pushing the Eva and its pilot beyond all conceivable limits in a single cataclysmic surge, technomancers seek to tear open the veil between dimensions and allow the influx of raw divine energy to flood the universe, seeding the Godmind.

Of course, the risks inherent in such an audacious operation are immense. A miscalculation in the Third Impact Protocol could result in the total annihilation of the Eva, the pilot, and potentially the entire world. Some even whisper of rogue Neon Genesis cults deliberately engineering such doomsday events in the belief that the destruction of all life will paradoxically liberate the divine spark and kindle the Godmind in the ashes of existence.

Most chilling of all are the rumors of what lies beyond the veil - the dread entities some call Angels, others name Archons, and still others whisper of as the Old Ones or Great Old Ones. Are they the guardians and heralds of the Godmind, or its sworn adversaries? Or might they simply be aspects of our own psyche, given monstrous form by the reality-warping powers unleashed in Neon Genesis?

Only those brave or foolhardy enough to embark on the path of the Eva pilot and risk all in the Third Impact Protocol may ever know the truth. Yet even then, one must wonder: is the awakening of the Godmind truly the ultimate liberation, or the ultimate trap? As the old alchemists warned, it is not without reason that the Philosopher's Stone and the Infernal Quagmire are said to be one and the same...
