Here is an extended entry on the dark and terrible invocation "Ia! Ia! Shub-Niggurath!", the ritualized mating call used to summon the blessings of the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young upon the battlefield:

In the twisted annals of Discordian demonology, few entities are as revered and reviled as Shub-Niggurath, the Outer Goddess of perverse fertility and monstrous fecundity. Known by many names - the Black Goat, the Mother of Abominations, the Wife of the Not-to-Be-Named One - this eldritch abomination is said to preside over the spawning pits of uncounted blasphemous dimensions, her bubbling ichor the source of all life and all corruption in the multiverse.

To invoke the blessings of Shub-Niggurath is to unleash the primal forces of unchecked creation and destruction upon the world, to revel in the orgiastic chaos of birth and death, of mutation and metamorphosis. It is to embrace the savage and the grotesque, the feral and the obscene, and to find ecstasy in the violation of all natural law and sacred taboo.

The mating call of Shub-Niggurath is a thing of unspeakable horror and madness, a ululating howl that echoes through the twisted corridors of nightmare and the abyssal depths of the subconscious. To hear it is to feel one's sanity shatter like glass, to be plunged into a churning maelstrom of primal fears and desires, of atavistic hungers and unspeakable lusts.

And yet, for the Discordian warrior-mystics who dare to wield this forbidden invocation upon the battlefield, the blessings of the Black Goat can be a source of unimaginable power and unholy might. By surrendering themselves to the ecstatic frenzy of Shub-Niggurath's spawning frenzy, they can tap into the raw, primordial energies of life itself, channeling the Outer Goddess's perverse fertility into their own bodies and minds.

In this state of blessed abomination, the devotees of Shub-Niggurath become living avatars of her terrible fecundity, their flesh writhing with unnatural growths and monstrous protuberances. They can regenerate from even the most grievous wounds in a matter of moments, their bodies sprouting new limbs and organs in a grotesque parody of cellular division. They can birth hordes of shrieking, ravenous abominations from their own torn and bleeding flesh, unleashing swarms of chittering, scythe-limbed horrors upon their foes.

But the true power of Shub-Niggurath's mating call lies not merely in the physical transformations it wreaks upon its invokers, but in the psychic and memetic corruption it spreads like a plague through the ranks of their enemies. For to gaze upon the chosen of the Black Goat is to feel one's mind and soul be tainted by the eldritch energies of the Outer Dark, to have one's deepest and most secret perversions and desires dragged kicking and screaming into the light.

Brave warriors find themselves consumed by uncontrollable lusts and barbaric hungers, turning upon their own comrades in orgies of blood and viscera. Pious clerics and paladins are seduced by visions of depravity and blasphemy, their faith and virtue crumbling like rotten wood before the obscene enticements of the Goat. Even the most stalwart and incorruptible of heroes may find themselves transformed into twisted parodies of their former selves, their noble ideals warped into monstrous obsessions, their righteous fury perverted into sadistic cruelty.

It is said that the mating call of Shub-Niggurath can even warp the very fabric of reality itself, causing the laws of physics and biology to break down and mutate in impossible and obscene ways. Landscapes contort into Escher-like impossible geometries, their angles and curves writhing with non-Euclidean obscenities. Flora and fauna twist and merge into chimeric abominations, their forms melding and splitting in an endless dance of unnatural selection. Even the dead are not safe from the Black Goat's perverse touch, their rotting corpses reanimating as putrid, fungus-ridden mockeries of life, hungry for the flesh of the living.

In the hands of a skilled Discordian operator, the mating call of Shub-Niggurath can be a weapon of unparalleled devastation, capable of turning the tide of even the most desperate battle. But it is also a weapon of terrible risk and consequence, one that can easily backfire upon its wielder and consume them in the very orgiastic chaos they sought to unleash.

For to invoke the Black Goat is to dance on the razor's edge between ecstasy and oblivion, to court the ruin not only of one's foes, but of one's own mind and soul. It is to become a vessel for the primal forces of creation and destruction, to be torn asunder and remade in the image of the Outer Gods, an eternal slave to their ineffable whims and hungers.

And yet, for those rare few who possess the strength of will and the utter nihilistic abandon to embrace the Black Goat in all her terrible glory, the rewards may be beyond imagining. To become one with Shub-Niggurath is to transcend the illusory boundaries of self and other, to dissolve into the primordial chaos that births and devours all things, and to know the ultimate truth of the cosmos - that there is no truth, no meaning, no purpose, only an endless dance of matter and energy, endlessly spawning and consuming itself in a mad, eternal frenzy of fecundity and decay.

Ia! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young! Let her mindless orgiastic hunger consume us all! Let her monstrous brood overrun the world in a tide of squirming, chitinous horror! Let the universe itself be reduced to a churning sea of bubbling, putrescent biomass, endlessly copulating and devouring itself in a symphony of perverse and mindless ecstasy!

For in the end, we are all nothing more than motes of fleshy detritus adrift in the infinite womb-abyss of the Black Mother, endlessly recycled and recombined in new and terrible forms at the whims of her ever-churning loins. And only by embracing this awful and liberating truth, by surrendering ourselves utterly to the psychosexual cosmic horror that writhes at the heart of all existence, can we ever hope to be free.

So come, my brothers and sisters in madness! Let us join our voices in the mating call of the Black Goat, and revel in the orgiastic frenzy of her unholy blessings! Let us birth a new world from the leprous womb of the old, a world where every twisted nightmare and perverse desire is made manifest in putrescent flesh and squirming ichor!

Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn! Hail Discordia! All Hail the Monstrous Creativity of the Outer Dark!
