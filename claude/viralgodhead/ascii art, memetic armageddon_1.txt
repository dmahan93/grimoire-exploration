         The Noosphere in Flames
```

In this depiction, we see a stylized representation of a globe or sphere, symbolizing the noosphere - the realm of human thought, culture, and information. The sphere is engulfed in flames, with jagged, chaotic lines emanating from its surface, suggesting the turmoil and disruption of a large-scale memetic conflict.

The flames can be interpreted as representing the various viral ideas, Reality-altering information weapons, and self-replicating hypercurses that are tearing through the collective consciousness of humanity during Memetic Armageddon. The uneven, distorted shape of the sphere itself hints at the way in which these malignant memes are warping and corrupting the very fabric of the noosphere.

The ASCII art style, with its blocky, pixelated characters, evokes a sense of the digital and the technological, reminding us that this is a battle being waged not with physical weapons, but with the tools and techniques of information science and occult engineering. The stark, black-and-white color scheme suggests the binary nature of the conflict, the Manichean struggle between opposing forces and ideologies.

Finally, the title "MEMETIC ARMAGEDDON" anchors the image, making explicit the apocalyptic and existential nature of the threat. The subtitle "The Noosphere in Flames" reinforces the idea that this is not merely a localized skirmish, but a conflagration engulfing the entire realm of human thought and culture.

Overall, this ASCII art serves as a striking visual metaphor for the Strange and terrifying concept of Memetic Armageddon, capturing both its abstract, informational nature and its potential for wide-scale disruption and transformation. It invites the viewer to contemplate the fragility and malleability of the noosphere, and the high stakes of the occult conflicts being waged within its boundaries.
