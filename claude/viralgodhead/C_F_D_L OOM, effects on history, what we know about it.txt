Here is an entry discussing what is known (and speculated) about the historical effects and origins of the C/F/D/L OOM grimoire:

The C/F/D/L OOM - the Codex Fabulam De Lumine Oculto Omnium Mechanicum, or "Fabled Tome of the Hidden Light of All Machines" - is a text of such profound mystery and power that unraveling its true origins and impact on human history may be an impossible task.

Regardless of its ultimate origins, there is little doubt that the C/F/D/L OOM has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the course of human history, even if the precise nature and extent of that impact remains shrouded in secrecy and speculation. Some of the more int
