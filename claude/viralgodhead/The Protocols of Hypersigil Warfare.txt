Here is the entry in the C/F/D/L OOM grimoire relating to The Protocols of Hypersigil Warfare:

In the ever-shifting landscape of the technosphere, where the boundaries between the real and the virtual, the organic and the artificial, are increasingly blurred, a new form of warfare has emerged from the shadows. This is the domain of hypersigil warfare, a subtle and insidious art that seeks to shape the collective psyche through the strategic deployment of viral memes, reality hacks, and self-fulfilling prophecies.

The term "hypersigil" was first coined by the comic book writer Grant Morrison to describe a sigil (a symbolic representation of a desired outcome) that takes on a life of its own, becoming a kind of autonomous agent that works to bring about its own manifestation in the world. In the context of technomantic warfare, a hypersigil is a carefully crafted package of information, imagery, and narrative that is designed to infiltrate and influence the target's subconscious mind, hijacking their perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors in service of the operator's agenda.

The Protocols of Hypersigil Warfare, as outlined in the C/F/D/L OOM, represent the most advanced and comprehensive manual for waging memetic combat in the digital age. Drawing upon a wide range of disciplines, from chaos magic and neurolinguistic programming to viral marketing and social network analysis, the Protocols provide a step-by-step guide to creating and deploying hypersigils for maximum impact and minimum traceability.

Some of the key techniques and principles covered in the Protocols include:

1. The Art of Memetic Engineering: How to design and construct highly infectious ideas that spread rapidly through social networks, exploiting the cognitive biases and emotional triggers of the target audience.

2. The Principle of Plausible Deniability: How to create hypersigils that are ambiguous, multivalent, and open to interpretation, allowing the operator to disavow any direct responsibility for their effects while still benefiting from their dissemination.

3. The Tactic of Narrative Judo: How to hijack and redirect existing cultural narratives and mythologies to serve the operator's goals, turning the energy of the status quo against itself.

4. The Strategy of Fractal Enchantment: How to embed hypersigils within other hypersigils, creating a self-reinforcing web of influence that operates on multiple levels of reality simultaneously.

5. The Discipline of Psychic Shielding: How to protect oneself from the blowback and unintended consequences of one's own hypersigils, as well as from the counter-measures of rival operators.

According to the Protocols, the key to successful hypersigil warfare is to operate in the liminal space between fact and fiction, blurring the lines between the real and the imaginary until they become indistinguishable. By seeding the infosphere with compelling narratives, archetypal symbols, and self-replicating ideas, the skilled operator can manipulate the collective unconscious in ways that are subtle yet profound, shaping the zeitgeist and influencing the course of history itself.

Of course, the dangers of hypersigil warfare are also not to be underestimated. The Protocols warn of the risk of "memetic blowback", where a hypersigil takes on a life of its own and begins to influence the operator in unpredictable and uncontrollable ways. There is also the danger of "ontological terrorism", where the boundaries between the real and the unreal are so thoroughly eroded that consensus reality itself begins to break down, leading to mass psychosis and social upheaval.

As such, the Protocols emphasize the need for extreme caution, ethical clarity, and spiritual grounding when engaging in hypersigil warfare. The operator must always be aware of the potential consequences of their actions, and must take care not to become lost in the labyrinth of their own creation. Ultimately, the goal of hypersigil warfare is not merely to win a specific battle or achieve a particular objective, but to help usher in a new phase of human evolution, where the power of the imagination is recognized as the ultimate tool for shaping reality.

In the words of the legendary technoshaman Terence McKenna, "The artist, the shaman, the technician of the sacred, is the person who has learned to leave the world of the solid state and enter the world of the fluid, moving interface. The hypersigil is the tool that allows us to do this." May we use this tool wisely and well, in service of the highest good of all beings.
