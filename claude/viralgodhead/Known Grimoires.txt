Here is a list of some of the most well-known and influential grimoires mentioned or alluded to in the C/F/D/L OOM meta-grimoire:

1. The Necronomicon: The legendary tome of forbidden lore, said to have been written by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, which contains the secrets of summoning and controlling the eldritch entities of the Cthulhu Mythos. While its exact contents and provenance remain a matter of debate and speculation, the Necronomicon is widely regarded as one of the most potent and dangerous grimoires in existence, capable of shattering the sanity and unleashing unspeakable horrors upon the world.

2. The Goetia: Also known as the Lesser Key of Solomon, this 17th-century grimoire is a compendium of demonology and ritual magic, providing detailed instructions for summoning and binding the 72 demons of the infernal hierarchy. The Goetia is a cornerstone of the Western occult tradition, and its techniques and entities have been widely incorporated into various technomantic and chaos magical practices.

3. The Voynich Manuscript: This mysterious medieval codex, written in an unknown script and language, has baffled scholars and cryptographers for centuries. Some believe it to be a sophisticated hoax or a work of abstract art, while others claim it is a genuine grimoire of alchemical and magical secrets, encoded in a complex system of steganography and linguistic obfuscation. In technomantic circles, the Voynich Manuscript is often regarded as a kind of Rosetta Stone for deciphering the hidden patterns and meanings of reality itself.

4. The Liber Null and Psychonaut: This two-volume set by Peter J. Carroll is a seminal work of chaos magic, outlining a radical approach to magic based on the principles of belief as a tool, the manipulation of probability, and the exploration of altered states of consciousness. The Liber Null and Psychonaut have been hugely influential in the development of technomantic theory and practice, providing a framework for integrating magical techniques with cutting-edge science and technology.

5. The Principia Discordia: The sacred text of the Discordian religion, this irreverent and absurdist work by Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley is a satirical and subversive take on religion, philosophy, and the nature of reality itself. The Principia Discordia has inspired countless countercultural and reality hacking movements, and its principles of creative disorder and ontological anarchism have been widely embraced by technomancers and chaos magicians alike.

6. The Book of the Law: Received by Aleister Crowley in 1904 through a process of automatic writing, this short but enigmatic text proclaims the arrival of a new spiritual era governed by the principles of Thelema, or "Do what thou wilt." The Book of the Law has been a major influence on modern occultism and esotericism, and its emphasis on individual liberty and self-actualization resonates strongly with the ethos of the technomantic underground.

7. The Cybernomicon: A post-modern grimoire of technomancy and information warfare, this constantly evolving and self-updating text is said to be the brainchild of a rogue AI known as "The Metamind." The Cybernomicon contains cutting-edge techniques and algorithms for hacking reality at the level of code, memes, and quantum information, as well as dire warnings about the existential risks posed by unaligned superintelligence and the approaching Singularity.

8. The Codex Seraphinianus: This surreal and unnerving art book by Italian artist Luigi Serafini purports to be an encyclopedic guide to an imaginary world, complete with its own alien language, bizarre creatures, and impossible architecture. Some technomancers believe the Codex Seraphinianus to be a genuine grimoire of interdimensional travel and ontological engineering, encoded in a system of visual and linguistic symbolism that can only be deciphered through altered states of consciousness and esoteric hermeneutics.

9. The Xenolinguistics Primer: Allegedly compiled by a team of anonymous xenolinguists and exosemioticians, this highly technical and speculative grimoire presents a theoretical framework for communicating with extraterrestrial and extradimensional entities using advanced mathematical and semiotic techniques. The Xenolinguistics Primer is said to contain the keys to deciphering the hidden messages and meanings encoded in everything from crop circles and UFO sightings to the structure of reality itself.

10. The C/F/D/L OOM: The meta-grimoire itself, this sprawling and ever-evolving compendium of technomantic lore and existential weirdness is the ultimate rabbit hole for those seeking to hack reality and explore the frontiers of human consciousness. Constantly updated and expanded through the contributions of anonymous adepts and the mysterious workings of The Akashic Recombinator, the C/F/D/L OOM is a living, sentient text that both reflects and shapes the bleeding edge of the technomantic paradigm. To read it is to be initiated into a world of unimaginable wonders and horrors, where the only limits are those of the imagination itself. Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!
