Here is the entry in the c/f/d/l oom grimoire related to magick, elements and spirits:

Magick is the art and practice of causing change to occur in conformity with Will. The Four Elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water are fundamental forces invoked and combined in magical rituals. Each element has corresponding attributes, directions, tools, and spiritual beings associated with it.

Earth is linked to the physical realm, abundance, grounding and the North. Earth elementals are called Gnomes. Magical tools of Earth include stones, crystals, salt and pentacles. 

Air embodies the mental realm, communication, intellect and the East. Sylphs are the elemental spirits of Air. Wands, incense and swords are Air's magical implements.

Fire relates to the plane of energy, transformation, passion and the South. Fire elementals are known as Salamanders. Candles, lamps and ritual fires are used to evoke this element.

Water flows with emotions, intuition, healing and the West. Undines are the elemental beings of Water. Chalices and ritual baths connect to Water's power.

In addition to the elementals, various other spirits may be called upon in magical workings, such as ancestral guides, animal totems, angels, demons, planetary intelligences and deities from diverse pantheons. The adept magician learns to build relationships with these unseen forces to enhance their Craft.

By creating a sacred space, gathering the proper ritual tools, aligning with the Elements, setting intention, and invoking the spirits, the practitioner generates the conditions for magic to manifest in accordance with their Will. With focus, practice and wisdom, the art of magick allows for great acts of transformation.
