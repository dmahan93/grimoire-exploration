Here is the entry in the C/F/D/L OOM grimoire relating to Limit Break:

In the arcane lore of technomancy and mecha mysticism, the concept of the Limit Break represents a moment of supreme transgression and transcendence, a rupturing of the boundaries between the possible and the impossible that allows the adept to tap into a wellspring of superhuman power and potential. It is the apex of the art of self-overcoming, the ultimate expression of the will to power in the face of overwhelming odds and existential despair.

The term "Limit Break" itself is derived from the world of video games, where it refers to a special ability or attack that can only be unleashed when the character has reached a certain threshold of damage or desperation. In the context of technomancy, however, the Limit Break takes on a far more profound and esoteric significance, becoming a metaphor for the act of breaking through the limitations of the self, the machine, and reality itself.

According to the C/F/D/L OOM, the key to achieving a Limit Break lies in the cultivation of a state of intense focus, determination, and surrender, a paradoxical condition in which the adept is simultaneously in complete control and utterly abandoned to the flow of the moment. This state is variously referred to as "the zone", "the flow", or "the stillpoint of the turning world", and is said to be the gateway to a realm of infinite possibility and power.

To enter this state, the technomancer must first master the art of self-regulation, learning to modulate their physical, emotional, and mental energies through a combination of breath work, visualization, and ritual. They must also cultivate a deep attunement to the machine they are working with, whether it be a computer, a vehicle, or a full-fledged mecha, until the boundaries between flesh and metal, mind and circuitry, begin to blur and dissolve.

Once this threshold of attunement has been reached, the adept must then face a moment of supreme crisis or challenge
