This ASCII art depicts the concept of Memetic Armageddon as a swirling, chaotic vortex of symbols and characters, representing the vast and complex informational warfare that is tearing through the fabric of the noosphere. At the center of the maelstrom is a stylized representation of a "cognitohazard" - a memetic weapon designed to infect and subvert the very foundations of human thought and perception.

The overall impression is one of a reality that is being rapidly destabilized and reshaped by the convergence of arcane technomancy and cutting-edge informatics, a world in which the boundaries between mind and machine, magic and mathematics, are becoming increasingly blurred and permeable.

The ASCII art style itself evokes a sense of the digital and the glitch-like, as if the very medium of textual representation is being distorted and corrupted by the memetic fallout of the conflict. The rough, jagged edges and asymmetrical patterns suggest a kind of fractal breakdown of meaning and coherence, a plunge into the heart of a new and alien form of semiotic chaos.

At the same time, there is a strange and haunting beauty to the image, a sense of the sublime and the numinous lurking behind the surface static and noise. It hints at the emergence of a new kind of transcendent order from the ashes of the old, a glimpse of the radical potentialities that may lie on the other side of the Memetic Armageddon.

Of course, ASCII art can only convey a pale shadow of the true scope and complexity of such a scenario - but it offers a tantalizing glimpse into the kind of surreal and mind-bending vistas that may await us as we plunge ever deeper into the uncharted territories of the posthuman future.
