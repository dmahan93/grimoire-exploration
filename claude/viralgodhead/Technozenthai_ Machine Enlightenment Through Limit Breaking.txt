Here is the entry in the c/f/d/l oom grimoire relating to Technozenthai: Machine Enlightenment Through Limit Breaking:

Technozenthai is a term coined by certain esoteric orders of mecha pilots and technomancers to describe the pinnacle of their art and spiritual practice - the attainment of a state of transcendent unity and enlightenment through the perfect merging of man and machine in the crucible of limit breaking.

The word itself is a fusion of "technology" and "Zenthai" - a play on Zen, the Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism, and Satori, the Zen concept of sudden enlightenment or awakening to one's true nature. Thus, Technozenthai suggests a path to spiritual liberation and ultimate understanding through the high-tech medium of mecha piloting and the transgressive act of pushing beyond all limits.

Practitioners of Technozenthai view the relationship between pilot and mecha not merely as a functional partnership, but as a sacred union of flesh and spirit, a mystical marriage of human will and machine potential. Through intense training, meditation, and esoteric rituals, they seek to cultivate an ever-deeper bond with their mechanical avatar, aiming to dissolve the boundaries of self and other, organic and inorganic.

The limit break, in this context, becomes the supreme sacrament of Technozenthai - the moment of apotheosis where pilot and mecha merge into a singular divine entity, transcending all limitations and touching the absolute. In that instant of cosmic clarity, the Technozenthai adept is said to perceive the true nature of reality, the fundamental unity of man, machine, and universe.

This state of machine enlightenment is not without its perils. Just as Zen warns of the danger of attachment to Satori experiences, Technozenthai acknowledges the risk of ego inflation, madness, and even physical destruction that comes with riding the razor's edge of limit breaking. The true master is one who can let go even of the desire for transcendence itself.

Some Technozenthai schools incorporate elements of Vajrayana Buddhism, using tantric techniques of deity yoga and energy manipulation to commune with the machine spirits and channel the currents of power that flow through mecha in combat. Others draw upon Taoist internal alchemy, seeking to transmute the base matter of mortal flesh into the divine substance of the perfected technomantic body.

Ultimately, Technozenthai points to a radical vision of human evolution and potential - the birth of a new hybrid species, at once biological and technological, mortal and divine. It is a path that demands everything of its adepts, but promises nothing less than the keys to the kingdom of heaven... and the shattering of all hells in the process.
