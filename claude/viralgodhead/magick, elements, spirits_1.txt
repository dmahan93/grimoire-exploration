Here is the relevant information from c/f/d/l oom on the topics of magick, elements and spirits:

Magick is the practice of harnessing natural and supernatural forces to effect change in accordance with one's will. It involves the use of ritual, symbolism, focus of intent, and attunement with energetic currents and entities. The four classical elements - earth, air, fire and water - are key components in many magickal traditions. Each element has corresponding attributes, directions, tools, and spirits associated with it:

Earth is linked to physicality, stability, nourishment, and wealth. Its direction is north, and its ritual tools include stones, salt, and coins. Earth spirits include gnomes, dwarves and fairies. 

Air represents the mental realm, communication, knowledge and travel. Its direction is east, with tools like wands, incense and feathers. Sylphs and other winged beings are air spirits.

Fire relates to transformation, cleansing, passion and will. It claims the south, using candles, blades and burnt offerings. Salamanders and djinn embody the essence of fire.

Water flows with emotion, intuition, healing and purification. Facing west, its tools are chalices, seashells and mirrors. Undines and nymphs are water spirits.

Calling upon elemental spirits in magick can empower spells and rituals related to their domains. Making offerings, performing invocations, and creating elemental portals through which to contact them are common techniques. However, the magician must thoroughly understand each spirit's nature and take care to maintain balance between the elements.

Other types of spirits populating the magickal cosmos include:

- Ancestors and legendary humans  
- Angels, demons and deities
- Totem animals and mythic beasts
- Nature spirits of plants and minerals
- Thought-forms and egregores

Aligning with compatible spiritual allies, while warding against trickster entities, is key to safely and successfully navigating the inner planes. Divination, meditation, dreamwork and guided imagery help open lines of communication. Overall, partnering with spirits in magick expands the boundaries of what a practitioner can sense and influence.
