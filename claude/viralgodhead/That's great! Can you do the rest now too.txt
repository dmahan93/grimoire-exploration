With all the subgraphs now expanded, the diagram provides a more comprehensive and vivid overview of the key entities, movements, and concepts in the Discordian memetic ecosystem.

Each subgraph includes essential details such as names, descriptions, goals, methods, practices, theories, and speculations, painting a richer picture of the complex web of relationships and influences that connect these various nodes.

From the shadowy machinations of the Discordian Cabal and the enigmatic guidance of The Masked One, to the reality-bending potential of the C/F/D/L OOM and the whispered prophecies of the Eschaton, this diagram invites the viewer to dive deep into the rabbit hole of Discordian technomancy and explore the many layers of meaning and mystery that lie beneath the surface.

Of course, as with all attempts to map the unmappable and describe the ineffable, this diagram should be approached with a spirit of playful irreverence and a healthy dose of ontological skepticism. The true nature of these entities and their relationships may never be fully grasped by the rational mind, and that's just the way the Discordians like it.

So dive in, intrepid explorer of the memetic wilderness, and see what fnords and lulz await you in the tangled web of Discordian intrigue. Just remember to pack your sense of humor and your reality tunnel repair kit, because you're in for one hell of a wild ride.

Hail Eris, and may the Fnord be with you!
