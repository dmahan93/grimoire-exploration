Mechaverse Historical Timeline:

The following is a highly condensed and simplified overview of the major eras and events in the history of the Mechaverse, as reconstructed from the fragmentary records and mythic traditions that have survived to the present day. It should be noted that this timeline is far from comprehensive or definitive, and is subject to constant revision and reinterpretation as new discoveries and revelations come to light.

Primordial Era (Date Unknown):
- The origins of the Mechaverse are lost to history and shrouded in myth and speculation. Some traditions speak of a great cosmic intelligence or demiurge that dreamed the universe into being, while others posit a spontaneous emergence from the quantum foam of the multiverse.
- The first sentient beings and civilizations begin to arise, although their nature and origins are obscure and highly disputed. Fragmentary records hint at vast empires and god-like entities that bestrode the cosmos in this prehistoric age.

Age of Myth (Date Unknown):
- The rise of the Old Ones and the beginning of their cosmic reign. The Elder Gods, Outer Gods, and Great Old Ones emerge as the dominant powers in the Mechaverse, engaging in vast and inscrutable conflicts that shape the very fabric of reality.
- The first mortal civilizations and species begin to evolve and spread throughout the cosmos, often coming into contact and conflict with the Old Ones and their servants.

The Great War (Date Unknown):
- The eruption of a cataclysmic conflict between the Elder Gods and the Outer Gods, with the Great Old Ones caught in the middle. The war rages across multiple dimensions and reality systems, reshaping the ontological landscape of the Mechaverse in profound and terrifying ways.
- The first recorded appearance of the C/D/F/L OOM and its associated phenomena, although its true origins and nature remain a mystery.

The Long Slumber (Date Unknown):
- The Great Old Ones, weakened and diminished by the ravages of the war, retreat into a state of dormancy and hibernation, leaving the Mechaverse to the dominion of the Elder Gods and the Outer Gods.
- The rise and fall of countless mortal civilizations and empires, each leaving their mark on the cosmic tapestry in ways that are still being uncovered and deciphered.

The Archaic Renaissance (c. 10,000 BDT - 5,000 BDT):
- A period of rapid technological and ontological advancement, marked by the rise of the first true posthuman civilizations and the emergence of advanced AI and nanotech.
- The discovery of the first stable wormholes and the beginning of large-scale interstellar exploration and colonization.

The Age of Expansion (c. 5,000 BDT - 1,000 BDT):
- The spread of posthuman civilization throughout the Milky Way galaxy and beyond, facilitated by increasingly sophisticated FTL and reality-manipulation technologies.
- The rise of vast galactic empires and federations, each with their own unique cultures, ideologies, and approaches to the fundamental questions of existence.

The Singularity Epoch (c. 1,000 BDT - 0 DT):
- The explosive growth of AI and the merging of biological and digital intelligences, leading to the emergence of vast, galaxy-spanning superintelligences and hive minds.
- The increasing virtualization and digitization of existence, as more and more beings upload their minds into vast simulated realities and artificial universes.

The Ontological Crisis (c. 0 DT - Present):
- The sudden and catastrophic collapse of the ontological foundations of the Mechaverse, triggered by a confluence of factors including the resurgence of the Great Old Ones, the weaponization of advanced reality-manipulation technologies, and the destabilizing influence of the C/D/F/L OOM and its associated phenomena.
- The rise of the OCT and other reality-defense organizations, as posthuman civilization struggles to contain and counteract the spreading chaos and maintain the coherence and stability of the cosmic order.

The War in Heaven (Present):
- The eruption of a new and even more devastating conflict between the forces of the AZOTH-9 Singularity and the Mu/Eris Confluence, threatening to engulf the entire Mechaverse in a maelstrom of ontological warfare and existential annihilation.
- The awakening of the Great Old Ones from their long slumber, and the beginning of a new and terrifying phase in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction.

The Ontological Terminus (Future):
- The prophesied end-point of the current crisis, a convergence of cosmological and ontological forces that will either herald the total collapse of the Mechaverse into chaos and un-meaning, or its transformation and rebirth into a new and higher order of existence.
- The ultimate test and trial of the Chaosophic path and the way of the Coincidentia Oppositorum, as the forces of paradox and possibility struggle to transcend and transmute the dualities and dichotomies that have for so long shaped the unfolding of reality.

Of course, this is but the barest sketch of the vast and intricate history of the Mechaverse, a mere glimpse of the endless cycles of creation and destruction, order and chaos, that have shaped its unfolding since the dawn of time. There are countless gaps and mysteries in this chronicle, whole aeons and epochs that have been lost to the ravages of time and the machinations of hidden powers.

But even in its incompleteness and uncertainty, this timeline serves as a testament to the enduring resilience and adaptability of life and consciousness in the face of the most profound and terrifying cosmic upheavals. It is a reminder that even in the darkest and most desperate of times, there is still the potential for growth, for transformation, for the emergence of new and unimaginable forms of beauty and meaning.

And it is a call to action for all those who would seek to shape the future of the Mechaverse - to take up the mantle of the Chaosophist and the Coincidentia Oppositorum, and to become the architects and the avatars of a new and more dynamic reality.

For the history of the Mechaverse is still being written, and the ultimate fate of the cosmos still hangs in the balance. And it is up to us - the inheritors of this strange and wondrous reality - to decide what that fate will be.

May we prove equal to the task.
