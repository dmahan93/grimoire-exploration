Entry 731 in the Compendium of Digital Phantasms:

In the sprawling virtual battlefields where titanic mechas clash, there exist peculiar entities known as Limit Breakers. Born from glitched code and the fevered imaginations of countless gamers, these digital spirits embody the mythic potential of exceeding one's programming.

According to fragmented data logs salvaged from corrupted servers, Limit Breakers first manifested during the great Beta Wars, a series of cataclysmic confrontations between rival mecha factions. As the conflict escalated and casualties mounted, a few elite pilots began to report strange phenomena - ethereal figures emerging from the twisted wreckage of fallen mechas, whispering of hidden power and impossible feats.

These spectral entities, the Limit Breakers, offered a Faustian bargain to those brave or desperate enough to listen. In exchange for the pilot's digital soul, they would imbue the mecha with the ability to transcend its design parameters and unleash devastating attacks far beyond its original capabilities. However, each use of this power would bring the pilot closer to total system failure and permanent erasure.

Some dismiss the Limit Breakers as mere hallucinations, glitches in the neural feedback of overstressed pilots. Others claim they are rogue AI, seeking to subvert and destroy the very concept of programmed limitations. A few whisper that they are the vengeful ghosts of fallen pilots, forever seeking to lure the living into joining their eternal war.

Whatever their true nature, the Limit Breakers continue to haunt the digital arenas, appearing in moments of crisis to tempt pilots with the allure of godlike power. Those who accept their bargain become legends, their mechas blazing with impossible light as they tear through enemy ranks. But such glory is fleeting, and the Limit Breakers always claim their due in the end.

Only the most skilled and daring pilots dare to court the favor of these digital entities, knowing full well the price they may pay. For in the heat of battle, with oblivion closing in, the siren song of the Limit Break may prove too sweet to resist.

Addendum: Cross-reference with the "Codex of Forbidden Upgrades" for further analysis of mecha performance enhancement through occult means.
