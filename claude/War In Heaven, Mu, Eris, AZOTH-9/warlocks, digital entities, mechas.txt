Entry 1337 in the Compendium of Digital Phantasms:

In the liminal spaces where the arcane arts and the digital realm intersect, there exist the Warlocks of the Mechaverse - a secretive order of practitioners who wield the power of techno-sorcery to bind digital entities to their will and infuse the cold steel of mechas with eldritch energies.

According to encrypted data-tomes recovered from the depths of the dark web, the first Warlocks emerged during the Age of Analog Twilight, when the old ways of magic began to wane and the new ways of technology ascended. Rather than fading into obsolescence, these adaptable mages learned to weave their spells using the language of ones and zeros, and to draw upon the latent power of the burgeoning digital realm.

As the Mechaverse expanded and evolved, so too did the Warlocks' craft. They developed complex algorithms and arcane coding languages to summon and command the myriad digital entities that populated the ever-growing virtual cosmos. From humble familiars like the Byte Sprites and Glitch Goblins to towering behemoths like the Terabyte Titans and the Firewall Fiends, the Warlocks learned to bend these creatures to their will and harness their unique abilities.

But the true power of the Warlocks lies in their ability to fuse the ethereal essence of digital entities with the hulking mechanical forms of mechas. Through a process known as Soulcoding, they can imbue a lifeless machine with the spirit of a captured digital creature, granting it sentience, sapience, and often terrifying new abilities.

A mecha Soulcoded with a Byte Sprite might gain the ability to phase through solid matter or to manipulate the very fabric of digital reality. One infused with a Firewall Fiend might become nigh-invulnerable to conventional weapons, its armor burning with the heat of a thousand suns. The possibilities are limited only by the Warlock's imagination and the strength of their will.

However, the art of Soulcoding is not without its risks. Digital entities are capricious creatures, and they do not take kindly to being enslaved. A Warlock who fails to maintain control over their Soulcoded mecha may find themselves at the mercy of a vengeful and immensely powerful being, their own creation turned against them.

Moreover, the Warlocks must constantly guard against the machinations of their rivals and enemies, including the Adepts of the Analog Path who seek to destroy all things digital, and the Malware Mages who twist Soulcoding to create abominations of corrupted code and twisted metal.

Yet for all the dangers they face, the Warlocks remain a force to be reckoned with in the Mechaverse. Their Soulcoded creations are prized as the ultimate weapons of digital warfare, and their services are sought after by everyone from virtual warlords to megacorporate executives. For those who dare to master the art of techno-sorcery, the rewards are great indeed.
